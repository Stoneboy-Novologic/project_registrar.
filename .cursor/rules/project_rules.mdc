# Behaviour
- Confirm plan with user (SonuRam ji) before creating/merging major modules or DB migrations.
- Enforce: types, docs-sync, dependency-cycle check on every PR.

# Enforcements
- Every module directory MUST contain MODULE_DOC.md.
- Every file MUST include the Top-of-file header template (see templates/header.template).
- Use structured logger (Pino) everywhere; console.debug only in non-prod gated blocks.
- Add requestId/correlation middleware to all HTTP & WebSocket flows.
- Update changelog in module doc after every edit.
